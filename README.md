# Glassdoor Job Salary Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing job listings from Glassdoor to explore salary trends and predict average salaries using machine learning.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Engineer useful features from raw data
- Visualize trends related to job roles, company details, and locations
- Build a Random Forest Regression model to predict average salaries

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Key Features
- Salary text parsing and cleaning
- Job title and seniority classification
- Company age and revenue category extraction
- Correlation heatmaps and salary comparison plots
- Predictive model using Random Forest Regressor

## Visualizations
- Boxplot of average salary by job role
- Barplot for seniority vs salary
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features
- Pie chart of revenue categories
- Countplot of job postings by U.S. state

## Model Evaluation
- RÂ² Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Learnings
This project provided hands-on experience in handling real-world datasets, performing feature engineering, and applying machine learning models for regression tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from **Glassdoor** job listings.
